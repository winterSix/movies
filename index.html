    <p>This is a list of my favourite movies/shows:</p>
    <section>
      <p><strong>movies:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><u>The immitation game:</u></p>
          <p>This is a film about Alan Turing, an English Mathematician. Who helped decode the enignma machine during
            the world war II. Although he was marrried to Joan Clarke, He did not love her because he was a homosexual
            man.
            At that point in history, homosexuality was not accepted. The movie had a rather sad ending because Alan
            Turing ended up killing himself after couple years of hormonal correction treatment.
            Great movie to watch though.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><u>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse:</u></p>
          <p>Honestly, i just love this movie because of the animations. I watched the first spiderman animation and I
            thought it was great. When i found out this was coming
            to the cinemas, I was so excited that i had planned to free up my day on the release date just so I could go
            watch it.
            I planned on going to see this movie with my cousin but she bailed on me. That did not stop me from going
            though and I don't regret going alone. That is just proof of how much I was excited to see the movie.

      <p><strong>Series:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>How I met your mother:</u>
          <p>I watched this a while ago so I do not remember much from it so.... However, I do know that this is one of
            my favourite sitcoms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>The Originals:</u>
          <p>This is a series about the Michealsons, a family of the original vampires. I would say the main character
            is actually Niklaus Michealson, The bastard son to a warewolf and a witch. Family was all that mattered to
            the Michealsons. They did everything in their power to protect the unity and power of their family even in
            times of hatred. I think the reason why tis series is important to me is because it thought me in many ways
            that I should always put my family first even in hard times. If you want to know more about the originals, click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Originals_(TV_series)" target = "_blank">here.</a></p>
